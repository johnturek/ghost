	<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
	<p>
		Tech Knowledge Hub was created to bridge the gap between complex technical concepts and practical,
		real-world implementation. We believe that high-quality technical education should be accessible,
		clear, and actionable for developers at all experience levels.
	</p>

	<h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
	<p>
		Unlike many technical blogs that focus on cutting-edge trends or niche topics, we concentrate on
		<strong>foundational knowledge that stands the test of time</strong>. Our articles cover essential
		technologies and methodologies that form the backbone of modern web development.
	</p>

	<p>Every article on this site is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Thoroughly researched</strong> - We verify all technical information against official documentation and current best practices</li>
		<li><strong>Example-driven</strong> - Every concept includes working code examples you can use immediately</li>
		<li><strong>Accessibility-focused</strong> - Content follows WCAG guidelines and is screen-reader friendly</li>
		<li><strong>Regularly updated</strong> - We review and update articles to ensure they reflect current standards</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Our Content Standards</h2>
	<p>
		We adhere to strict quality standards for all published content:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Code examples are tested and verified before publication</li>
		<li>External links are checked for accuracy and relevance</li>
		<li>Technical accuracy is prioritized over brevity</li>
		<li>Complex topics are broken down into digestible sections</li>
		<li>Industry-standard terminology is used consistently</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
	<p>
		This site is built following the <strong>U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</strong> principles,
		emphasizing clarity, accessibility, and professional presentation. We use:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Public Sans typography for optimal readability</li>
		<li>WCAG AAA compliant color contrast ratios</li>
		<li>Semantic HTML for proper document structure</li>
		<li>Responsive design that works on all devices</li>
		<li>Fast-loading, optimized images</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Topics We Cover</h2>
	<p>
		Our content library focuses on six core areas of web development:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>JavaScript & TypeScript</strong> - Modern language features, type safety, and best practices</li>
		<li><strong>Web Frameworks</strong> - Building applications with popular frameworks and libraries</li>
		<li><strong>API Development</strong> - RESTful design, Node.js backends, and API best practices</li>
		<li><strong>CSS & Layout</strong> - Modern CSS techniques including Grid, Flexbox, and responsive design</li>
		<li><strong>Developer Tools</strong> - Git, version control, and development environment setup</li>
		<li><strong>Software Architecture</strong> - Design patterns, testing, and scalable application structure</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Community & Feedback</h2>
	<p>
		We welcome feedback and suggestions for new topics. If you notice an error in our content or have
		a suggestion for improvement, please let us know. Our goal is to create a trusted resource that
		serves the entire developer community.
	</p>

	<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
	<p>
		This site is built with <strong>Astro</strong>, a modern static site generator that prioritizes
		performance and developer experience. Content is written in Markdown with MDX support for
		interactive components when needed.
